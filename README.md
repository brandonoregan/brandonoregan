### Hi, Hello, Welcome, I'm Brandon O'Regan ðŸ‘‹

I began my journey in web development just over a year ago. When you struggle to sit through an entire film but find the challenges web development provides has you engaged for the entire day, forgetting meals, having hours turn into seconds, that might be a sign you've found a passion. Some people might even do something dramatic with that realization, like pausing their electrical apprenticeship, moving to Ireland, completing a UCD Diploma in Full Stack Development with UCD Professional Academy, traveling around Europe, learning and coding at every opportunity created, moving back to Australia and continuing to improve until their programming skills are undeniably valuable. If you're looking for someone for someone on course for undeniably valuable skills, let me know, I'd love to chat!
