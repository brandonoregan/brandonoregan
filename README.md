### Hi, Hello, Welcome, I'm Brandon O'Regan ðŸ‘‹

**brandonoregan/brandonoregan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I began my journey in web development just over a year ago. When you struggle to sit through an entire film but are completely engaged in from morning till night on the challenges web development provides, that might be a sign you've found a passion. Some people might even do something dramatic with that realization, like pausing their electrical apprenticeship, moving to Ireland, completing a UCD Diploma in Full Stack Development with UCD Professional Academy, traveling around Europe, learning and coding at every opportunity created, moving back to Australia and continuing to improve until their programming skills are undeniably valuable. And some people might just take the comfortable option and that's ok too. :)
